On the subject of group orientation and the making of cohesive and enjoyable games

I have written this forum post (or, dare I say, a manifesto) in reply to a recent request for various ideas regarding the reformation of a game development group I am currently a member of. I believe, though, any game development group could make use of the following principles. Also keep in mind that it may have a few typos or grammatical errors, as I hastily sketched this all up in about an hour or two. I hope you find this useful nonetheless. Enjoy.

&emsp; The primary purpose of a game development group is to bring creators of various kinds together to consolidate resources such that they can decide upon and achieve goals including, but not limited to, and in no particular order:<br><br>

#1) Creation of generic assets to be used in existing or future projects
#2) The manipulation of aforementioned assets to create a single project that has potential to become a game, for entertainment, experimenting, etc.
#3) Finding new members that can be trusted to complete certain tasks in realistic time frames, and do so in a manner that is transparent, mindful of the limitations of other group members as well as the players of the games that the assets will be featured in, and the hardware said people use
#4) What games to produce, how they will be constructed, what game play elements they will possess (and how they will be implemented,) an extended time line in which various goals regarding development will be met, and who will be assigned to development roles within that game

These are paramount to the purpose of a development group, and when any of them are not adhered to, the group is put in danger of becoming merely an association of people who make an incoherent mess of what are often incomplete, unrelated, and inadequate games (often to a point that they cannot even be considered games.) Anyone who requires proof of this can look at the depressingly large amount of failed development studios throughout ROBLOX.

The primary issue is a lack of knowledgeable and invested leadership. It is absolutely critical that the entity that possesses leadership of a group, be it a single individual or otherwise, immediately assess the capabilities of each member and determine what the group can accomplish as a whole. Having done so, this leadership entity, as it will be known from this point forward as the director, must put members to work immediately, not necessarily on a game, but on anything that may be of use in future titles. For example, artistic and architecturally adept individuals could be put to work on generic assets such as houses, props, weapons, and so on, while programmers could be put to work creating logic for weapons, game management, and AI. When an idea for a game (or group of games) is put forward, the existing assets can be utilized in that game. Furthermore, the members will be in a prime position to begin working on assets targeted specifically toward that game, as they are already familiar with existing features of the engine, and will have likely developed better skills and workflows along the way.

Secondly, there is clearly a large number of people who fail to assess themselves and realize their own limits. Worse still, there are some who attempt to make fantastic, overly complex, and gratuitously massive games that are far beyond the capabilities of even the best teams in existence. It is an unfortunate consequence that massive amounts of resources are wasted in vainly trying to achieve such lofty goals, only to be forced to abandon the project because it had become to unwieldy, or because the engine could not handle the load of such a game (ROBLOX is NOT Unreal Engine.) I implore you to not make the same mistake as a single developer or as a group. Remember, games like Battlefield: Hardline are made with engines that possess powerful tools that make them uniquely qualified to make such titles. ROBLOX, while a good engine, cannot achieve anywhere near the same feats that make Alien: Isolation, as it is, a playable and enjoyable game.

Speaking of individuals and their abilities, I would like to point out that design, organization, and standard-setting is key. A common mistake among studios I've come to know is a failure to implement standard a standard workflow for members to follow. An easily relatable example of this is employing builders that do not adhere to the measurement system (studs) and fail to consistently translate objects by increments of 1, .25,.5, etc. A programming equivalent is making an API that does not adhere to a common naming convention, or, alternatively, not making an API at all, but instead littering the workspace with specialized scripts that cannot interface with one another. An additional, but very important example is a failure to group similar objects together in such a way that anyone can look at the hierarchy (take the workspace, for example) and determine where something is. It is much easier to find, say, a flower model under Workspace > OutdoorEnvironment > Plants > Flowers than it is to find it in a jumbled, unorganized mess of a workspace with 21,000 objects in it. Anyone who fails to make the workspace organized is creating a metaphorical haystack in which you must find a needle. Such amateur mistakes constitute the epiphany of bad game development. The director must design (with much input by knowledgeable individuals) a workflow that is precise, clean, and intuitive, so that members can work together in the most efficient, cohesive, and expedient way possible.

Lastly, and most importantly, understand this. The most successful games you will ever make as a group will rarely ever be elaborate FNAF knockoffs, rather, they will often be simple and elegant titles that are unique, new, and exciting. After all, isn't that how murder mystery games became a hit?
