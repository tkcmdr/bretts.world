&emsp;Few essays have explored the ways of warfare in quite so comprehensive a fashion as Sun Tzu’s <em>The Thirteen Chapters</em>, widely known as <em>The Art of War</em>. In Samuel B. Griffith’s translation of this ancient Chinese classic, we find numerous verses covering every aspect of warfare, ranging from training and leadership, reconnaissance and attack formations, counterintelligence and optimal conditions to attack, and numerous other affairs. Sun Tzu’s meditations on warfare are not only numerous, but are presented with striking profoundness and simplicity; many passages consist of contemplative discussions, each accompanied by a befitting proverb or explanation. The remarkable readability, extensive observations, and applicability of Sun Tzu’s <em>Thirteen Chapters</em> lend to its great significance to military strategists.

&emsp;Griffith’s rendition of Sun Tzu’s <em>The Thirteen Chapters</em> is a remarkable work, perhaps among the greatest English translations available. The profound qualities of Sun Tzu’s work are purveyed superbly in Griffith’s publication. Many passages are complemented by informative footnotes and disambiguations. In the preface, Griffith discusses <em>The Art of War’s</em> integration into modern cultures and its increasing relevance to military commanders; Griffith, a former US Marine Corps. Brigadier General himself, expresses no small amount of interest in Sun Tzu’s writings. The book is concluded with a rich appendix further delving into the peculiarities of <em>The Thirteen Chapters</em>, in addition to dozens of relevant Chinese commentaries. Among the numerous modern translations produced, Griffith’s work perhaps best depicts Sun Tzu’s extensive and enlightening writings on the art of war.
